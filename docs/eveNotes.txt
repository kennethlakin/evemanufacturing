Observed max range from feature until disappearance of all mobile and static objects in it: ~377km.

For POSs, ~365km away from the central control tower and all of the objects vanish.

Looks like fastest base ROF is 2.00 sec per cycle.
  Gunnery V gives us a 10% boost.
  Rapid Firing V gives us another 20% boost.
  Small Projectile Burst Aerator II gives us another 15%.
   With these modifications, the expected max ROF is ~1.36 sec per cycle.
 A sim tick time of 10Hz should be more than plenty for accuracy.

Looks like 2->4k man battles are the expected maximum size for now. See:

Claims are that Time Dialation kicks in at ~1400 total in a system, assuming that you
don't call ahead for server reservations. See:
